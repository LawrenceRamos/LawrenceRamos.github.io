		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="Images/Adobe.jpg" alt="A photo of an Adobe symbol">
		<p>Growing up, I played a lot of sports and had played basketball for the majority of my life. I thought I was going to go to the NBA, until I realized I was 5 foot 8 inches and not that athletic. This was when I had decided I wanted to find a new passion in my life, and at the time, a new digital communications class was being created at my high school. I decided to drop weight lifting and take the digital communications class in the middle of my junior year, what a decision that was!</P>
		
		<p>Because I was involved with the digital communication class, I wanted to try and enter a video contest to put my learning to the test. I had entered a video contest put on by McDivitt Lawfirm open to the entire state of Colorado. The contest asked each contestant to come up with a 30-second public service announcement that addressed the issue of distracted driving. I wrote a script, filmed and edited the piece, and ended up winning the statewide contest. Because I won, McDivitt awarded me by giving me a brand new MacBook Pro and I have not stopped creating content since!</P>
		
		<p>I continued to work on my craft throughout high school by volunteering to film skits for the school, commercials, and other types of content as well. During this time, I was working at Cold Stone, an ice cream parlor, trying to save up as much money as I could to buy myself my own DSLR camera. As soon as I had enough money, I went to BestBuy and bought my camera, and then quit my job at Cold Stone. From that point forward, I have only made money by creating media.</p>
		
		<p>I got a job creating content for District 60, which is where I still work today. In this job, I film events such as parades, board meetings, football games and any school-related functions that may happen within District 60. I also do jobs on the side like filming weddings, music videos, quinceaneras, commercials, and creating social media content as well! I plan to continue to learn and work on my digital communication craft in college and eventually enter the workforce with skill sets that will make me a valuable asset on any team that I may join.</p>
